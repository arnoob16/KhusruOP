# KhusruOP

An app made with the help of an [opensource api](https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api) that fetches memes from Reddit.
You can download the app from my Drive [by clicking here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_zji6WyOeAL6rehrbBCUvXydSOGeZFO0/view?usp=sharing).

We can get memes from reddit and share them with friends easily over social media platforms using this app. 
It is named after one of my friends who uses Reddit a lot. 

This was another guided project by [Anuj Bhaiyya](https://github.com/Anuj-Kumar-Sharma) on his [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58_wzhvJta3hDSPvRLDAqg/videos).
