# KhusruOP

An app made with the help of an (opensource api)[https://github.com/R3l3ntl3ss/Meme_Api] that fetches memes from Reddit.

We can get memes from reddit and share them with friends easily over social media platforms using this app. 
It is named after one of my friends who uses Reddit a lot. 

This was another guided project by (Anuj Bhaiyya) [https://github.com/Anuj-Kumar-Sharma] on his (YouTube Channel)[https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC58_wzhvJta3hDSPvRLDAqg/videos].
